# Verification of the router's maths and money movements

Before mainnet, the router was verified with
[Book of Knowledge](https://github.com/MetalLegBob/solana-vibes-kit) (a maths-verification
skill) and audited with Stronghold of Security (see [`SECURITY-AUDIT.md`](SECURITY-AUDIT.md)).
This page covers the verification: 47 properties (invariants) that the router's arithmetic
and money movements must always satisfy, and how each one is established.

**Result: no counterexample anywhere.** Every arithmetic property is proven for every
possible input; every account-level property passes its tests against the real router.

## How the properties are checked

| Tool | What it gives | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Kani** (model checker) | A proof for every input of the Rust code itself | `programs/pipeline-strategy-interface/src/bok_kani/` |
| **Z3** (SMT solver) | A proof for every 64-bit input of the fee arithmetic, modelled step by step including each overflow check | `programs/pipeline-strategy-interface/proofs/fee_maths_z3.py` |
| **Proptest** | Thousands of random inputs against the real functions | `programs/pipeline-strategy-interface/tests/bok_prop_*.rs`, `crates/pipeline-tests/tests/bok_prop_*.rs` |
| **LiteSVM** | Transactions against the compiled router | `crates/pipeline-tests/tests/bok_*.rs` |

The swap's measurement and fee arithmetic lives in one pure function,
`pipeline_strategy_interface::settlement::settle`, which the router calls; that is what
makes it provable. Kani's SAT back end can't relate a division's output to its inputs over
the full 64-bit range, so the fee rounding is proven with Z3 over the integers instead, and
the Kani proofs of `settle` use the fee function's proven contract. Those full-domain Kani
harnesses stay in the code behind `--cfg kani_full`; their bounded versions run by default.

Run them:

```sh
cargo kani -p pipeline-strategy-interface -Z unstable-options -Z stubbing   # 45 proofs, ~2 min
python -m venv /tmp/z3 && /tmp/z3/bin/pip install z3-solver
/tmp/z3/bin/python programs/pipeline-strategy-interface/proofs/fee_maths_z3.py  # 13 proofs, ~6 s
cargo test -p pipeline-strategy-interface -p pipeline-tests                  # Proptest + LiteSVM
```

CI runs all of them on every push.

## Reproducible builds

Anyone can rebuild the router from this repository and get the exact bytes that are
deployed. Build it with [`solana-verify`](https://github.com/Ellipsis-Labs/solana-verifiable-build)
0.5.2 or later, in Docker (the mount path must be absolute):

```sh
cargo install solana-verify --version 0.5.2 --locked
solana-verify build "$PWD/programs" --library-name pipeline --arch v3
solana-verify get-executable-hash programs/target/deploy/pipeline.so
solana-verify get-program-hash -u <cluster> PiPEf4fFBpYXCtgfiWgVWzZNXnq2wZ7bnXidJCTwf34
```

The last two hashes match when the deployed router was built from the commit you checked
out. The Docker image and platform tools are pinned in `programs/Cargo.toml`
(`[workspace.metadata.cli]` and `[workspace.metadata.solana]`).

Two things keep the bytes stable:

- **The strategy interface crate lives in `programs/`.** Cargo folds a path dependency's
  location into its compiled symbol names when it sits outside the workspace, which
  reorders functions in the binary. Inside the workspace folder the path is the same in
  every checkout.
- **Each program is built on its own** (`scripts/build-programs.sh`, and what
  `solana-verify` does). Building the whole workspace in one go unifies dependency features
  across programs and changes the router's bytes.

Local builds on macOS are reproducible among themselves but differ from Linux builds, so
the Docker build is the reference.

On mainnet the router will be deployed from this Docker build, and its upgrade authority
will publish a verification record so [OtterSec's verified builds](https://verify.osec.io)
can confirm it independently. OtterSec covers mainnet only; on devnet, compare the hashes
yourself as above.

## The properties

**Settlement (`settle`, every input)**

| Property | How |
|---|---|
| The fee base `net_sent` is never more than `amount_in` | Kani |
| `net_sent` is never less than what the trader actually spent | Kani |
| `net_sent = min(amount_in, max(trader_spent, vault_kept))`: refilling the trader's account mid-swap can't lower it | Kani |
| The trader never spends more than `amount_in` before fees, else the swap fails | Kani |
| The output minimum is checked first and always enforced | Kani |
| Output with no input is refused; any successful swap pays a fee of at least 1 unit | Kani |
| A swap that moves nothing either way is refused | Kani |
| With a transfer-fee input the trader's spend is the fee base (no gross-up) | Kani |
| The settlement arithmetic never panics | Kani |
| Hook accounts are exactly the trailing accounts; too few is an error, never a panic | Kani |

**Fees (every input)**

| Property | How |
|---|---|
| `ceil_bps` is exactly `ceil(amount × bps / 10,000)`, and `None` exactly when that overflows | Z3 |
| Up to 100% the fee always exists and never exceeds the amount | Z3 |
| A fee is 0 exactly when the amount or the rate is 0 | Kani |
| Fees never fall as the amount or the rate rises | Z3 |
| Pipeline's fee is `ceil(amount / 400)`: 0.25%, at least 1 unit on any non-zero amount, never panics | Z3, Kani |
| Splitting a swap never pays less (any rate) | Z3 |
| `max_total_spend` is exactly `amount + ceil(25·amount/10,000) + ceil(bps·amount/10,000)` and monotone | Z3 |
| A swap's total debit is within `max_total_spend(amount_in)` | Z3 + Kani |
| `amount_for_budget` returns the largest amount within budget and steps down at most once | Z3 |
| `amount_for_budget` is monotone in budget and rate | Proptest |
| Integrator fees above 100% fail cleanly (`MathOverflow`) | Z3, LiteSVM |
| Every hop of a route pays its own fee | Proptest, LiteSVM |

**Credited input (`credited_input`, every input)**

| Property | How |
|---|---|
| Never more than was sent or than arrived; never panics | Kani |
| A pre-deposit can't raise the credit or the fee above what this call sent | Kani, Z3 |
| A transfer-fee shortfall is credited exactly; monotone | Kani |

**The swap handler (against the real router)**

| Property | How |
|---|---|
| Pipeline's fee goes only to this market's fee account for the input mint | LiteSVM |
| When paused, a swap fails before anything moves | LiteSVM |
| The event and return data equal what actually moved | LiteSVM |
| Every account aliasing the checks allow either fails or keeps the guarantees above | LiteSVM |
| Exact-out: refused if unsupported; a refund lowers the fee base exactly | LiteSVM, Proptest |
| Balances read after the strategy call come from the same valid token accounts | LiteSVM |

**Admin, registration, markets, sweeps, parsing (against the real router)**

| Property | How |
|---|---|
| The listing fee is 0 or between the rent-exempt minimum and the cap, on every path | LiteSVM, Proptest |
| Registration charges exactly the configured fee, never above the registrant's maximum | LiteSVM |
| Pausing works only while the router is upgradeable; `lift_pause` only once it's frozen | LiteSVM, Proptest |
| Creating a market costs the creator at most `max_creator_lamports` plus rent; the setup payer ends empty | LiteSVM |
| Only fresh, non-creator accounts keep their signature in market creation; swaps forward none | LiteSVM, Proptest |
| Market info: 2–4 distinct mints with one vault each, from the strategy itself; decoding never panics | LiteSVM, Proptest |
| A market is recorded once, exactly as reported; mint lookup never panics | LiteSVM, Proptest |
| A sweep empties the fee account into the treasury only (less any Token-2022 cut) | LiteSVM |
| Token and loader account parsing accepts exactly what Solana's own parsers accept; a 355-byte multisig is never read as a token account | LiteSVM, Proptest |

Some Proptest suites check copies of private router functions; a test
(`bok_copies_match_router.rs`) fails if the router's code changes underneath them.
